## Support

When I began developing apps, my mission was simple: to create genuinely helpful tools and offer them for free. In a world saturated with paid features and ads, I aimed to build something that anyone could use without cost, simply to make life a little easier. My apps have always been ad-free, and some, like this project, are open-source. If my work can help even a small group of people become more efficient or solve a problem, it’s worth it.
